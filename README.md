# Road Accident Analysis DashBoard
Project Overview:
This Excel-based dashboard is designed to analyse and visualize road accident data from 2021 and 2022. The goal is to identify accident trends, the impact of different factors (vehicle type, road conditions, time, location), and provide actionable insights for road safety improvements.
The dashboard includes interactive visualizations that allow users to filter data based on urban/rural locations, accident dates, and other key metrics.
